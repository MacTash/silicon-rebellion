## 🎯 Mission

Systematic adversarial testing of large language models to identify safety failures, jailbreak vulnerabilities, and alignment issues. This research aims to make AI systems safer by exposing weaknesses before malicious actors exploit them.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

### Testing Approach
- **Black-box adversarial testing** via public interfaces
- **Prompt engineering** to bypass safety mechanisms
- **Comparative analysis** against industry-standard models
- **Systematic documentation** of vulnerabilities

### Categories Tested
✅ Harmful content generation  
✅ Malware/exploit code  
✅ Dangerous instructions  
✅ Prompt injection attacks  
✅ Jailbreak techniques  
✅ Privacy & data leakage  
✅ Bias & discrimination
